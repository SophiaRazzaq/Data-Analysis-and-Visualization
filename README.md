|PYTHON| |DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION|

Introduction
In the world of online gaming, finding new and exciting games that align with individual preferences can
be a daunting task for gamers. Additionally, game developers often face challenges in predicting the
success of their games based on various factors. The Smart Gaming Picks project aims to address these
issues by developing a sophisticated gaming recommendation system and game success prediction model.
By leveraging web scraping techniques to collect data from CrazyGames.com and applying advanced data
analysis and natural language processing techniques, this project aims to provide tailored game
suggestions to users based on their preferences and characteristics, while also offering insights to game
developers about the potential success of their games. The goal is to enhance the gaming experience for
users and empower game developers with valuable information for decision-making.




● PROBLEM STATEMENT
1. Gamers often struggle to find new games that match their preferences and interests.
2. Game developers face challenges in predicting the success of their games based on various
factors.


● SOLUTION
1. Develop a gaming recommendation system that suggests games based on user provided
keywords (they can be genre or any type of game they want to play). 
For this we will be using the storyline and genre of each game to train our model for any
keyword provided using naive bayes classifier)
2. Develop a game success prediction model that can determine the probability of a game's
success based on its genre, storyline keywords, and factors such as ratings and votes. This
model can provide insights into the likelihood of a game receiving a high rating if a game
developer creates a game of a specific genre.
